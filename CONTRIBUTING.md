# Contributing Issues
 
## Raising an Issue
* Please raise issues to the project mailing list <plx@finos.org> ([Web Archive](https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/forum/#!forum/plx)). Some people from project teams currently can't access build-in github issue tracker from corporate network.
* Please also tag the new issue with either "Bug" or "Enhancement".
 
# Contributing Pull Requests (Code & Docs)
To make review of PRs easier, please:
 
 * For major enhancements before working on any PR, please review the proposal with the project group via mailing list <plx@finos.org> to align it with roadmap.
 * Please make sure your PRs will merge cleanly - PRs that don't are unlikely to be accepted.
 * For code contributions, follow the general structure of the existing code.
 * For documentation contributions, follow the general structure, language, and tone of the existing docs.
 * Keep PRs small and cohesive - if you have multiple contributions, please submit them as independent PRs.
 * Minimize non-functional changes (e.g. whitespace shenanigans).
 * Ensure all new files include a header comment block containing the [Apache License v2.0 and your copyright information](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#apply).
 * If necessary (e.g. due to 3rd party dependency licensing requirements), update the NOTICE file with any required attribution or other notices
 * If your contribution includes source code for any Category B-licensed dependencies, please get a pre-approval from project leads via mailing list and then add an appropriate notice to this CONTRIBUTING file
