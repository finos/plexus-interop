==== .NET/web interoperability sample

:imagesdir: ./images

This sample demonstrates interoperability calls between .NET Core console apps and web app running in Electron. As an example let us test how request-response and discovery work:

. Build samples - see <<how-to-build, How to build>> for details

. Go to `bin/win-x86/samples/greeting` directory

. Launch Interop Broker – `LaunchBroker.cmd`

. Launch sample "Greeting Client" app – `LaunchGreetingClient.cmd`

. Choose “Discovery” option (5) first and then “Greeting from Electron Web app” option from discovery response:

. Enter some name (e.g. “John”) and press Enter. Broker will launch "Web Greeting Server" app, which is configured to run in Electron container.
Once launched the app will show the information about connection and incoming request and will send back a greeting response:

. "Greeting Client" app should receive the greeting and print it:

. Now choose Discovery (5) option in "Greeting Client" again and this time select “Greeting from .Net app” option from discovery results.

. Enter another name, e.g. “Mike” and press enter. Broker will start a ".NET Greeting Server"console app. Once running this app will print information about the incoming request and will send back the greeting:

You may check other call types by choosing other options in the "Greeting Client" app.
