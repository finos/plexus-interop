# Contributing to Plexus Interop
Thanks for your interest in the project! Here is some basic information about how to contribute.
 
# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
A CLA is a document that specifies how a project is allowed to use your
contribution; they are commonly used in many open source projects.

All contributions to [Fintech Open Source Foundation](https://www.finos.org/) projects must be made under a [Contributor License Agreement](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Legal+Requirements) that must also be met.

_NOTE:_ Commits and pull requests to FINOS repositories will only be accepted from those contributors with an active, executed Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) with FINOS OR who are covered under an existing and active Corporate Contribution License Agreement (CCLA) executed with FINOS. Commits from individuals not covered under an ICLA or CCLA will be flagged and blocked by the FINOS Clabot tool. Please note that some CCLAs require individuals/employees to be explicitly named on the CCLA. 

Pull requests (PRs) submitted to the project cannot be accepted until you have a CLA in place with the Foundation.

*Need an ICLA? Unsure if you are covered under an existing CCLA? Email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org)*
 
# Contributing Issues

## Prerequisites

* [ ] Have you [searched for duplicates](https://github.com/finos-plexus/plexus-interop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=)?  A simple search for exception error messages or a summary of the unexpected behaviour should suffice.
* [ ] Are you running the latest version?
* [ ] Are you sure this is a bug or missing capability?
 
## Raising an Issue
* Please raise issues to the project mailing list <plx@finos.org> ([Web Archive](https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/forum/#!forum/plx)). Some people from project teams currently can't access build-in github issue tracker from corporate network.
* Please also tag the new issue with either "Bug" or "Enhancement".
 
# Contributing Pull Requests (Code & Docs)
To make review of PRs easier, please:
 
 * For major enhancements before working on any PR, please review the proposal with the project group via mailing list <plx@finos.org> to align it with roadmap.
 * Please make sure your PRs will merge cleanly - PRs that don't are unlikely to be accepted.
 * For code contributions, follow the general structure of the existing code.
 * For documentation contributions, follow the general structure, language, and tone of the existing docs.
 * Keep PRs small and cohesive - if you have multiple contributions, please submit them as independent PRs.
 * Minimize non-functional changes (e.g. whitespace).
 * Ensure all new files include a header comment block containing the [Apache License v2.0 and your copyright information](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#apply).
 * If necessary (e.g. due to 3rd party dependency licensing requirements), update the NOTICE file with any required attribution or other notices
 * If your contribution includes source code for any Category B-licensed dependencies, please get a pre-approval from project leads via mailing list and then add an appropriate notice to this CONTRIBUTING file
